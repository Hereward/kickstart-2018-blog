> A starter platform for Meteor projects. 

This project is intended to be starting point for meteor web app projects. It uses a collection of packages which I found helpful and innovative. 

All code is in Typescript. The front-end is React.

The project contains a complete user registration process using custom templates including email verification and (optionally) 2 factor authentication.

The project uses both Bootstrap 4 and Material UI design elements.

There are 3 pages in the default site, with a built-in rich text editor (Quill):

* Home
* About
* Profile

The Home page also contains an implementation of the simple todos example from the Meteor Guide.


## Included Packages

* React
* Typescript
* Bootstrap 4
* Material UI
* Speakeasy 2FA
* Quill RTE
* VeliovGroup/Meteor-Files
* Bootstrap 4
* Bootstrap 4
