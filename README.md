> A starter platform for Meteor projects. 

This project is intended to be starting point for meteor web app projects. It uses a collection of packages which I found helpful and innovative. 

All code is in Typescript. The front-end is React.

The project contains a complete user registration process using custom templates including email verification and (optionally) 2 factor authentication.

The project uses both Bootstrap 4 and Material UI design elements.

There are 3 pages in the default site, with a built-in rich text editor (Quill):

* Home
* About
* Profile

The Home page contains an implementation of the simple todos example from the Meteor Guide.

The About page features the Quill rich text editor.

The Profile page features a form for uploading personal data as well as an image.

## 2FA Security

2 Factor authentication is becoming increasingly necessary in apps and websites these days. This project uses the Speakeasy package and is configured to work with Google 2FA.

## Install

Installation is done in the standard way - refer to Meteor docs for examples.

## Deploy

A sample configuration for the Meteor Up package is provided. The config files are stored in .deploy in the project root.

## Settings

Meteor settings files are stored in the .deploy folder. There is a production and a development version.

## NPM Function Calls

In the package.json file you will find 3 NPM function names:

* start - this launches meteor with the development settings file.
* deploy - this will deploy the app (you need to configure mup deploy first)
* deploy-cache - this will deploy a cached version of the app (useful when changing config settings only)
